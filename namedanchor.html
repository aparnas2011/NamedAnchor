        <h2>PSLV</h2>
        <img src="E:\images\image 3.jpg"alt="" width="100" hspace="10" vpsace="10"
        <p>The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is an expendable medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by the Indian Space
        Research Organisation (ISRO). It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into 
        sun-synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV in 1993, commercially available only from Russia. 
        PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).[8]Some notable payloads launched by 
        PSLV include India's first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India's first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) 
        and India's first space observatory, Astrosat.[2]PSLV has gained credence as a leading provider of rideshare services 
        for small satellites, due its numerous multi-satellite deployment campaigns with auxiliary payloads usually ride sharing 
        along an Indian primary payload.[9] As of February 2021, PSLV has launched 342 foreign satellites from 36 countries.[10]
        Most notable among these was the launch of PSLV-C37 on 15 February 2017, successfully deploying 104 satellites in
        sun-synchronous orbit, tripling the previous record held by Russia for the highest number of satellites sent to 
        space on a single launch,[11][12] until 24 January 2021, when SpaceX launched the Transporter-1 mission on a 
        Falcon 9 rocket carrying 143 satellites into orbit.[13]</p>
        <p>By 1981, confidence grew in remote sensing spacecraft development with launch of Bhaskara-1 and the PSLV project objectives were
        upgraded to have vehicle deliver 1000 kg payload in 900 km SSO. As technology transfer of Viking rocket engine firmed up,
        a new lighter configuration shifting away from relying on three large solid boosters was proposed by team led by A. P. J. 
        Abdul Kalam and eventually selected.[21][22] Funding was approved in July 1982 for finalized design employing a single large
        S125 solid core as first stage with six 9 tonne strap-ons (S9) derived from SLV-3 first stage, liquid fueled second stage (L33)
        and two solid upper stages S7 and S2. This configuration needed further improvement to meet the orbital injection accuracy
         requirements of IRS satellites and hence solid terminal stage (S2) was replaced with a pressure fed liquid fueled stage
        (L1.8 or LUS) powered by twin engines derived from roll control engines of first stage. Apart from increasing precision,
        liquid upper stage also absorbed any deviation in performance of solid third stage. Final configuration of PSLV-D1 
        to fly in 1993 was (6 Ã— S9 + S125) + L37.5 + S7 + L2.[18][19]The inertial navigation systems are developed by
         ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) at Thiruvananthapuram. The liquid propulsionstages for the second and fourth stages
        of PSLV as well as the Reaction control systems (RCS) are developed by the Liquid 
        Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Mahendragiri near Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. The solid propellant motors are processed at 
        Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh which also carries out launch operations.
        The PSLV was first launched on 20 September 1993. The first and second stages performed as expected, but an attitude control 
        problem led to the collision of the second and third stages at separation, and the payload failed to reach orbit.[23] After this initial setback, the PSLV successfully completed its second mission in 1994.[24] The fourth launch of PSLV suffered a partial failure in 1997, leaving its payload in a lower than planned orbit. In November 2014, the PSLV had launched 34 times with no further failures.[25] (Although launch 41: August 2017 PSLV-C39 was unsuccessful.[2])
        PSLV continues to support Indian and foreign satellite launches especially for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. 
        It has undergone several improvements with each subsequent version, especially those involving thrust, efficiency as well 
        as weight. In November 2013, it was used to launch the Mars Orbiter Mission, India's first interplanetary probe.[26]</p>

       <h2>ARABSAT</h2>
       <img src="E:\images\image 4.jpg" width="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"
       <p>The Arab Satellite Communications Organization (often abbreviated as Arabsat) is a communications satellite operator in 
        the Arab World, headquartered in the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Arabsat was created to deliver satellite-based, public and private
         telecommunications services to the Arab States, in accordance with International Standards. With 21 member countries, the organization 
         plays a vital role of enhancing communications in the Arab World.[1]The Arabsat satellites are a series of geostationary 
         communications satellites launched from 1985 through 2019. Some of the later satellites in the series remain operational in orbit, 
         while others have been retired and are derelict.</p>
        <p>The foundation of Arab Satellite Communications Organization (Arabsat) dates from the late 1960s. In 1967, information ministers of Arab states developed a series of principles in relation to a satellite network, 
        to create an integration of social and cultural activities among the Arab League countries. On the other hand, the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU) was established in 1969. Saudi Arabia did not join this Egypt-led and Cairo-based union until 1974, most probably due to the tense relationship between Saudi Arabia and Egypt at the time.
        On 14 April 1976, Arabsat was formed under Arab League jurisdiction with the goal of serving the information, 
        cultural and educational needs of its member states. Saudi Arabia was the main financier of the new organization 
        due to its expanded financial resources as a result of its flourishing oil-exporting industry. Riyadh housed Arabsat's headquarters.
        The first launch Arabsat-1A was performed by a French Ariane rocket. The American Space Shuttle Discovery launched Arabsat's 
        second satellite, Arabsat-1B, in 1985. Arabsat-1A and -1B were switched off in 1992 and 1993, respectively.</p>

        <h2>Space and Mans Future</h2>
        <img src="E:\images\image 5.jpg" width="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"
        <p>The future of space exploration involves both telescopic exploration and the physical exploration of space by robotic spacecraft and human spaceflight.
        Near-term physical exploration missions, focused on obtaining new information about the solar system, are planned and announced4
        by both national and private organisations.There are tentative plans for crewed orbital and landing missions to the Moon and Mars
        to establish scientific out posts that will later enable permanent and self- sufficient settlements.
        Further exploration will potentially involve expedition and the other planets and settlements on the moon
        as well as establishing Mining and fueling outposts, particularly in the asteroid belt.
        Physical exploration outside the solar System will be robotic for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>The Landsat program with its design and potentials was certainly a great model and yardstick for the
        IRS programme. IRS-1A was the first remote sensing mission to provide imagery for various land-based applications, such as agriculture,
        forestry, geology, and hydrology.[3] The mission's 
        long-term objective was to develop indigenous remote sensing capability.[4]</p>

        <h2>IRS-1A</h2>
        <p>IRS-1A, Indian Remote Sensing satellite-1A, the first of the series of indigenous state-of-art remote sensing satellites,
        was successfully launched into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit on 17 March 1988 from the Soviet Cosmodrome at Baikonur. IRS-1A carries two sensors, LISS-1 and LISS-2, with resolutions of 72 m (236 ft) and 36 m (118 ft) respectively with a swath width of about 140 km (87 mi) during each pass over the country. Undertaken by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). 
        It was a part-operational, part-experimental mission to develop Indian expertise in satellite imagery.The availability of Landsat 
        imagery created a lot of interest in the science community. The Hyderabad ground station started receiving Landsat data on
        a regular basis in 1978. The Landsat program with its design and potentials was certainly a great model and yardstick for the
        IRS programme. IRS-1A was the first remote sensing mission to provide imagery for various land-based applications, such as agriculture,
        forestry, geology, and hydrology.[3] The mission's 
        long-term objective was to develop indigenous remote sensing capability.[4]</p>
        
        <p>Following the successful demonstration flights of Bhaskara-1 and Bhaskara-2 - experimental Earth observation satellites developed and built by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) - and launched in 1979 and 1981, respectively, India began the development of an indigenous IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite) program. India realized quite early that sustaining its space program in the long run would depend on indigenous technological capabilities (in particular, US export restrictions made this clear). 
        Keeping this in mind, besides building satellites, India embarked as well on satellite launch vehicle development in the early 1970s. 
        As a consequence, India has two very capable launch systems at the start of the 21st century, namely PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch
        Vehicle) and GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle). 1)
        IRS is the integrated LEO (Low Earth Orbit) element of India's NNRMS (National Natural Resources Management System)
        with the objective to provide a long-term spaceborne operational capability to India for the observation and management 
        of the country's natural resources (applications in agriculture, hydrology, geology, drought and flood monitoring, marine studies,
        snow studies, and land use). The intend of the program is to create an environment of new perspectives for the 
        Indian research community as a whole, to stimulate the development of new technologies and applications, and 
        to utilize the Earth resources in more meaningful ways.</p>

        <h2>Review of Indian space Programme</h2>
        <img src="E:\images\image 6.jpg" width="150" hspace="10" vspace="10"
        <p>The second chapter traces the growth of astronomy in India from Vedic times through the middle ages up to the renaissance in Europe which coincided with the colonial consolidation in India. One of the features of this period is the opening up of several modern observatories in India to serve the East India Company and later Great Britain. One of the significant outcomes of this period is the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Subsequent chapters 
        describe the rise of Indian scientific institutions in detail both in the pre Independence and post-independence periods. 
        This includes Indian scientific organizations like the Aligarh Scientific Society, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science and the Astronomical Society. Life and contributions of leading Indian scientists starting with J.C. Bose and including Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai have been covered in detail.
        The role of Bhabha and Pandit Nehru, the then Prime Minister in putting India on the Space Map is discussed at length. 
        It was Bhabha who appointed Vikram Sarabhai to lead INCOSPAR which was later to become ISRO. Physical Research Laboratory 
        was the cradle where INCOSPAR and later ISRO were nourished. INCOSPAR was formed to consolidate Indiaâ€™s contribution to COSPAR, an international body set up in 1958 to focus on international cooperation in space research. This is where the story of Indiaâ€™s leap into space begins.
        The book explores the many twists and turns, successes and failures of TERLS which started so modestly in the Church of Mary
        Magdalene in a little known hamlet called Thumba. In this narrative the introduction of the space activities of Pakistan is a 
        bit jarring and out of place. Perhaps the author wished to contrast the space activities of the two newly independent nations but
        it really doesnâ€™t fit into the sequence of events. Also the inclusion of SITE in this chapter of the initial years is equally jarring.
        In fact, SITE and INSAT studies were contemporaneous and deserved a separate chapter.
        ISRO Centres are dealt with in detail in Chapter 8 but the inclusion of Antrix in this section is misplaced. 
        Antrix is not a part of ISRO and could have been dealt with in the chapter of commercialization.
        Nevertheless, the story of Antrix is also the story of the coming of age of Indiaâ€™s space program.
        The authorâ€™s bias towards rockets becomes apparent again with three full chapters on SHAR, launch vehicles and the saga
        of the development of cryogenic engines. The treatment is detailed and very informative.</p>
